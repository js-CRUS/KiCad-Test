KiCad CI Workflow

Automated schematic/PCB validation and file generation for this KiCad hardware project.

Overview

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically processes the KiCad project whenever schematic or PCB files change. The workflow:

Runs ERC on the schematic

Runs DRC on the PCB (only if it contains real copper layers)

Generates PDF exports, Gerbers, Drill files, BOM, and Pick-and-Place

Uploads all results as downloadable artifacts

All generated files appear in the folder:
outputs/

What the Workflow Does
1. Detects KiCad File Changes

The workflow only runs if files ending with:

.kicad_sch

.kicad_pcb

are modified.
This prevents unnecessary builds.

2. Schematic Processing

ERC is executed

Errors cause the CI to fail

A schematic PDF is created and saved to outputs/

3. PCB Processing (Conditional)

The workflow checks whether the PCB contains copper layers.

If the PCB has no layers, DRC and PDF export are skipped

If the PCB is valid, CI generates:

PCB PDF

DRC report

Gerbers

Drill files

Pick-and-Place

BOM

4. Artifact Upload

All outputs are bundled automatically and available to download under:

GitHub → Actions → (Select run) → Artifacts → kicad-outputs

🚨 IMPORTANT: Set Your Project Name

You must tell the workflow the base name of your KiCad project.
This is required so the CI can find:

your_project.kicad_sch
your_project.kicad_pcb

How to find your project name

Look in your project folder for files ending in:

.kicad_sch

.kicad_pcb

Example files:

my_board.kicad_sch
my_board.kicad_pcb


Your project name is my_board.

Where to change it in the workflow

Open:

.github/workflows/kicad-ci.yml


Find this section near the top:

env:
  PROJECT_NAME: "CHANGE_ME"


Replace "CHANGE_ME" with the actual project name:

env:
  PROJECT_NAME: "my_board"


This must match the filename (without extension), or the CI will not find your KiCad files.

Files Generated by CI

After a successful run, the following files are generated:

Schematic Outputs

PDF export

ERC report

PCB Outputs (only if PCB has copper layers)

PDF export

DRC report

Gerber files

Drill files

Pick-and-Place CSV

Bill of Materials CSV

All of these appear in:

outputs/

Badges

To enable the workflow status badge, update this URL:

https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/your-username/your-repo/kicad-ci.yml


Replace:

your-username

your-repo

with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

Notes

This CI setup is designed for KiCad 9.

PCB checks are automatically skipped if the board has no layers.

The workflow runs only when KiCad files change—saving time and build minutes.
